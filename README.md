# PCAPdroid-API

PCAPdroid-API is a modified version of [PCAPdroid](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid) to make capturing from adb much easier by disabling the capture dialog and the restrictions of socks proxies. To use this app after installation, things will go different from the original/stock version of PCAPdroid.

Demonstration:

```bash
adb shell am start -e action start -e pcap_dump_mode udp_exporter -e collector_ip_address 127.0.0.1 -e collector_port 5123 -e app_filter com.tencent.mobileqq -n com.emanuelef.remote_capture.debug/com.emanuelef.remote_capture.activities.CaptureCtrl
```

Note: you still need to manually click first-time dialogs and permission requests. After that, the process can be automatic. You may need to keep the screen on to ensure the target activity is launched.

Original README as follows:

PCAPdroid is a privacy-friendly open source app which lets you track, analyze and block the connections made by the other apps in your device. It also allows you to export a PCAP dump of the traffic, inspect HTTP, decrypt TLS traffic and much more!

PCAPdroid simulates a VPN in order to capture the network traffic without root. It does not use a remote VPN server, instead data is processed locally on the device.

</p>

Features:

- Log and examine the connections made by user and system apps
- Extract the SNI, DNS query, HTTP URL and the remote IP address
- Inspect HTTP requests and replies thanks to the built-in decoders
- Inspect the full connections payload as hexdump/text
- [Decrypt the HTTPS/TLS traffic](https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/tls_decryption) and export the SSLKEYLOGFILE
- Dump the traffic to a PCAP file, download it from a browser, or stream it to a remote receiver for real-time analysis (e.g. Wireshark)
- Create rules to filter out the good traffic and easily spot anomalies
- Identify the country and ASN of remote server via offline DB lookups
- On rooted devices, capture the traffic while other VPN apps are running

Paid features:

- [Firewall](https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/paid_features#51-firewall): create rules to block individual apps, domains and IP addresses
- [Malware detection](https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/paid_features#52-malware-detection): detect malicious connections by using third-party blacklists

## Integrating into your APP

Some features of PCAPdroid can be integrated into a third-party app to provide packet capture capabilities.

- For rooted devices, the [pcapd daemon](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid/tree/master/app/src/main/jni/pcapd) can be directly integrated into your APK to capture network packets.
- For all the devices, PCAPdroid [exposes an API](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid/blob/master/docs/app_api.md) to control the packet capture and send the captured packets via UDP to your app. This requires to install PCAPdroid along with your app.

## Third Party

- [zdtun](https://github.com/emanuele-f/zdtun): TCP/UDP/ICMP connections proxy
- [nDPI](https://github.com/ntop/nDPI): deep packet inspection library, used to extract the connections metadata
- [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy): a local proxy used to perform TLS decryption

For the complete list of third party libraries and the corresponding licenses check out the "About" page in the app.

## Building

1. On Windows, install [gitforwindows](https://gitforwindows.org)
2. Clone this repo
